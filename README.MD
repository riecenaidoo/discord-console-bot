# Discord Relay Bot (Experimental)

This project intends to create a service that can relay various
forms of information from a local program, into a Discord server, via a locally hosted Discord bot.

This project is still in its early stages of development.

## Requirements

- Python
- [Discord Bot Token](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
  - To run the main script, copy the token into a plain text file saved in this
    directory under `config/token.txt`. The token controls access
    to your Bot, so keep it safe.
- ffmpeg
  - FFMPEG is an open source suite of libraries for handling various types
    of multimedia streaming and is required by example snippets
    streaming audio into Discord voice channels. - [Read More](https://ffmpeg.org/)
  - `sudo apt install ffmpeg` or `sudo apk add ffmpeg`
